# 🚗 Vehicle Telemetry Dashboard

**Monitor, visualize, and analyze vehicle performance in real time – all from your browser!**

This interactive **Vehicle Telemetry Dashboard** simulates live car data — including engine RPM, speed, temperature, and fuel level — and presents it in an engaging, data-rich interface.  
Built with **Streamlit**, **Plotly**, and **Python**, it provides an immersive diagnostic environment that feels like a real vehicle monitoring system — but entirely virtual and safe to explore.
